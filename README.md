Slightly modified 3arthh4ck 2.0.0 Added several new modules
1. The anchor has been improved and now it works much better
2. Automine2 - works with the included automine from the future and breaks the enemy's surround. It is made at the highest level. The best public automine.
3. HitboxCity is a module similar to clip, but works a little differently.
